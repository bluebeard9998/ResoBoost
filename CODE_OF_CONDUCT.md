# ResoBoost Code of Conduct

> A steady hand, a respectful word, and engineering done in good faith.

This project follows a clear, time‑tested standard for community conduct so that collaboration can flourish. Our Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant 3.0** and tailored to the ResoBoost project.

---

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community **welcoming, safe, and equitable for all**. We commit to a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof), sexual identity and orientation, or any other characteristic.

We will act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment

* Showing empathy and kindness to other community members
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Assuming good intent where reasonable, and asking for clarification instead of making assumptions

### Examples of unacceptable behavior

* Harassment of any kind (verbal, written, or visual), including slurs or derogatory comments
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment, doxxing, or publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
* Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior
* Sustained disruption of discussions, issues, pull requests, or community meetings

## Scope

This Code applies in **all project spaces**, including issues, pull requests, discussions, wikis, code review, and any other channels (e.g., chat or social media) where an individual represents the project or its community. It also applies when you are **officially representing** the project in public.

## Community Moderators & Responsibilities

Project maintainers and designated moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Moderators have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions not aligned to this Code, and may temporarily or permanently restrict participation.

## Reporting

We prefer **private reports** so concerns can be handled promptly and respectfully.

* **Email (preferred):** *\[REPLACE WITH CONTACT]* (e.g., `conduct@yourdomain.example` or a dedicated team email). This inbox should be monitored by project moderators.
* **GitHub reporting tools:** You may use GitHub’s in‑product **“Report to repository admins”** on comments or profiles to alert maintainers; for platform‑wide or urgent safety issues, you can also use **“Report abuse to GitHub Support.”**
* **If your report involves a moderator:** Contact another moderator, or—if none are available—use GitHub Support’s abuse report.

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information (optional)
* A description of what happened and where (links, screenshots)
* Any additional context, such as whether the behavior is ongoing or has happened before

We will acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as we reasonably can and keep the reporter’s identity confidential to the extent permissible.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

Our approach is **restorative** and **proportional**. Consequences are chosen to stop harm, protect participants, and encourage learning and accountability. Possible actions include, singly or in combination:

1. **Private coaching or warning** — clarifying the standard and expected changes in behavior.
2. **Content moderation** — editing/removing unacceptable content; asking for revisions before re‑engaging.
3. **Mediation** — facilitating a respectful conversation between participants when safe and appropriate.
4. **Temporary limitations** — e.g., muting, limiting assignments/reviews, or a temporary ban from project spaces.
5. **Final measures** — e.g., removal from the organization or a permanent ban from project spaces.
6. **Re‑entry** — where appropriate, a clear path for return that emphasizes accountability, learning, and community safety.

Moderation decisions are made by moderators with all available information and context; we may seek external advice for complex cases.

## Appeals

If you believe a moderation action was made in error or was disproportionate, you may **appeal in writing** to the moderators via the reporting email within 30 days. Appeals should explain the decision being appealed and provide any relevant context.

## Protecting Vulnerability Reports

Security issues should **not** be reported via public issues or discussions. Please follow the project’s security policy (see the repository’s **Security** tab) or contact the maintainers privately.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the **Contributor Covenant 3.0**, © Organization for Ethical Source, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and released under the **Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International** license. Portions of language may also reflect GitHub’s Community Guidelines and moderation tooling.

## Updating This Code

Community norms evolve. Proposed improvements to this Code can be submitted via a pull request. Changes will be discussed openly and adopted by consensus of the moderators.
