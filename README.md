## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Overview
**ResoBoost** is a cross-platform network performance tool built with **Tauri** (Rust back-end) and a **React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS** front-end. It benchmarks DNS resolvers and download speeds, producing metrics such as average latency, jitter, success rate, DNSSEC validation, and per-server bandwidth.

---

## ‚ùì Why ResoBoost

Most ‚Äúspeed test‚Äù websites only check your current resolver or CDN connection. **ResoBoost** lets you compare many DNS providers and measure download throughput via those servers on your own machine:

- **DNS metrics beyond ping:** median latency, jitter, success rate, DNSSEC validation, and IP responses per resolver.
- **Real download bandwidth:** resolves a host via each DNS server, streams data from a URL, and reports bytes read, duration, and Mbps.
- **Protocol diversity:** work with classic UDP/TCP resolvers and modern DoH/DoT/DoQ lists; load defaults or your own lists.
- **Customisable and private:** edit/import resolver lists via the UI; export results to CSV.

---

## üéØ Features

- üöÄ **Cross-platform desktop app** via Tauri (small footprint, fast startup).
- üìä **DNS benchmarking:** latency (median), jitter, success rate, DNSSEC status, and resolved IPs.
- üì• **Download speed testing:** per-DNS bandwidth measurement for any HTTP/HTTPS URL.
- üìù **CSV export:** save DNS and download results with one click.
- üß† **Dynamic resolver lists:** load default UDP/TCP/DoH/DoT/DoQ or regional lists, import from URL, or edit manually.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Configurable tests:** domain/IP, sample count, timeouts, DNSSEC, warm-up, per-DNS duration, etc.
- üíª **Modern tech stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4, Tauri 2; Rust libs include `hickory-resolver`, `tokio`, `reqwest`, `serde`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

- The UI uses @tauri-apps/api to invoke commands in the Rust layer.

- The DNS tester initialises resolver and TLS host lists, can refresh them from remote files, then runs concurrent lookups.

- The speed tester resolves the target host per DNS server and performs streaming downloads to calculate bandwidth.

---

## üöÄ Quickstart (TTFS ‚â§ 5 minutes)
### Prerequisites
- Rust (stable)
- Node.js ‚â• 16 (v18+ recommended)
- bun (bundled) or your preferred package manager
> Windows: install MSVC build tools.
> Linux: ensure Tauri deps like libwebkit2gtk and openssl dev headers are installed (see Tauri docs).
> macOS: Xcode command-line tools.
### Clone & Install
   ```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/ednoct/ResoBoost.git
cd ResoBoost

# install JS dependencies
bun install
   ```
### Run in Development
   ```bash
# start the UI + Rust back-end in dev mode
bun run tauri dev
   ```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Most options are set via the UI, but the following environment variable can be useful during development:
Custom DNS server lists are fetched from the DNS_SERVERS repository on start and can be refreshed or edited via Server Lists ‚Üí Edit. You can load default sets for UDP/TCP, DoH, DoT, DoQ, or region-specific lists, or paste your own.

## üñáÔ∏è Integrations & Compatibility
- OS: Windows, macOS, Linux, android (Tauri)
- Front-end: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4
- Rust: Tauri 2, hickory-resolver, reqwest, tokio, serde
- Extensibility: strongly-typed result objects; easy to integrate new pages/components or expose additional Tauri commands.

## ü§î Troubleshooting / FAQ
- ‚ÄúNetwork unavailable‚Äù errors ‚Üí check firewall/VPN; the app needs outbound DNS/HTTP.
- DNSSEC fails ‚Üí not all resolvers support DNSSEC; try disabling it or use a DNSSEC-enabled resolver.
- Custom servers won‚Äôt save ‚Üí one server per line; supported forms include:
     - `8.8.8.8` (UDP/TCP)
     - `tls://1.1.1.1@cloudflare-dns.com` (DoT)
     - `https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query` (DoH)
     - `quic://1.1.1.1:784@dns.cloudflare.com` (DoQ)
- Low download speed ‚Üí increase per-DNS test duration, pick a closer mirror, or verify your network path.

## üí° Roadmap
-  Pre-built installers and auto-update support
-  CLI mode for headless benchmarking / CI integration
-  Additional metrics (packet loss, jitter distributions, upstream tests)
- Tagging/favourites and better server list management
- Built-in charts and historical comparisons

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Responsible Disclosure
If you discover a security vulnerability (for example in the DNS resolution logic or Tauri packaging), please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainer (see GitHub profile) with details. We appreciate responsible disclosure and will respond quickly.
